<h1>About Us</h1>

<p> Steamin' Mugs is pleased to be the first coffee shop in Downtown Boston to serve "Stumptown Coffee" and "Third Wave Coffee" products exclusively. Stumptown, originating in Portland Oregon had been named "Best Coffee in the World" by NPR, The New York Times, Food & Wine Magazine, and USA Today. To ensure exceptional quality and freshness we obtain our beans directly from Stumptown's roasting facility in Brooklyn, New York.</p>


<p> Opened its doors in December 2010, Steamin' Mugs is ideally located just steps from the Boston Common. We are committed to providing the premier coffee experience in Boston by serving only the finest coffees, teas, and freshly baked pastries.</p>
